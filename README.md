# Trip Planner 
A small modal that acts like a wizard to help users to find a desired vacation.

## The Problem
Lots of times people don't know what they are looking for, they just know that they are looking for vacation - 
and usually they have a set of needs, wishes or desires that they are looking to find. This wizrad is made for those who 
don't know how to search for the vacation they need, or for those who are too lazy to do it.

## The Goal
The goal of this wizard is to allow people to find a vacation that is in the style and nature of their personality, 
current status or needs. The idea is to create a smart filter that will help people find what they want much faster.

## Demo
Currently the wizard is not doing much, it is only has 3 screen to collect data from the users. After a user had
finish filling the wizard's fields, he's choices will be shown on the main page and the wizard modal will fade away. 

## Desired results
The idea is that after a user will finish filling all the different fields, 
he would then be shown a list of vacation options he could choose from.

## Dependencies
The current implementation depend on:
- jQuery(version 3.2.1, but even older versions will work)
- jQueryUI
- Underscore(_)
